The work developed in this thesis is framed in the context of the ATLAS detector \cite{ATLAS:1999vwa}, 
a general-purpose particle physics detector that records events arising from collisions within the 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator built to date. 
This experimental setup is located at CERN, one of the world's premier centres for scientific inquiry.

This chapter is devoted to the introduction of the CERN laboratory and a description of the technical
design of LHC and ATLAS.
The CERN organisation is presented through an overview of its history, its achievements and 
some of the most relevant research projects carried out currently.
The essential technical aspects of the LHC machine design are covered. The distribution and functioning of the
accelerator complex and the main experiments conducted at LHC are summarised as well. 
Finally, a full overview of the different components of the ATLAS detector is provided, presenting
the specific features of each part.

\section{CERN}
%\paragraph{History}
The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is the largest particle physics laboratory in the
world. The convention establishing CERN was ratified in 1954.
Its name is derived from the French acronym \textit{Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire}, which 
was the provisional body designated in 1952 to foster the fundamental physics research in Europe, and the 
acronym has been maintained until CERN's foundation.
Initially formed by 12 member states, now it has 23 member states and many non-European countries involved
in different ways such as associate members, partners and observers \cite{CERN_membersates}.

The main site of the laboratory is located at Meyrin, a municipality of the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland), 
at the Franco–Swiss border. There are other sites in the vicinity of the Meyrin site, being the most relevant %of these 
the Prévessin Site, the CERN’s second-largest site, straddling the communes of Prévessin-Moën (France).

%\paragraph{Contributions}
Since its beginning, CERN's objective has been helping to uncover what the universe is made of and how it works.
CERN started its first accelerator, the Synchrocyclotron, on 1957 and rapidly observed the electron decay
of the pion for the very first time \cite{PhysRevLett.1.247}. Thereafter, the laboratory has continued contributing
to particle and nuclear physics and to more technical fields.%, such as computer science.
 For instance, one of the most significant achievements made through CERN experiments 
 was the discovery in 1973 of neutral currents in the Gargamelle bubble chamber located 
 in the Proton Synchrotron (PS) \cite{HASERT1973138}. This was indirect evidence of the 
 existence of the \PZ boson and, a decade later, in 1983, CERN announced the discovery 
 of the \PZ and \PW bosons \cite{doi:10.1080/00107518608211015} at the UA1 and UA2 
 experiments within the Super Proton Synchroton (SPS). This achievement earned CERN 
 its first Nobel Prize in 1984.
Other major successes of CERN were the determination of the number of light neutrino families  at the Large Electron-Positron  % Neutrino families presented at \ref{sec:chap1:SM_and_EParticles}
Collider (LEP) on 1995 \cite{DECAMP1989519} and the creation for the very first time of antihydrogen atoms in 1995 at the PS210 
experiment \cite{BAUR1996251}. 
More crucial accomplishment followed such as the discovery during the 1990's of \CP violation by NA31 \cite{BARR1993233_NA31} 
and NA48 experiments \cite{1999335NA48}. 
And, in 2012, the Higgs boson discovery by ATLAS and CMS\cite{20121_ATLAS_HiggsDiscovery} 
\cite{201230_CMS_HiggsDiscovery}, a fundamental test for the robustness of the SM as described in Section \ref{sec:Chap1:HiggsPhys_discovery}. 
More recently, in 2015, a state consistent with a pentaquark was observed at LHCb \cite{LHCb:2015yax}. 


%\paragraph{Experiments}
Currently, a wide diversity of projects are carried at CERN being the most renowned of them the LHC and its experiments which 
are described in more detail in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:LHC}. In addition, fixed-target experiments, antimatter experiments and experimental 
facilities make use of the LHC injector chain. The main fixed-target experiments at CERN are the Antiproton Decelerator
(AD) \cite{Maury:1997lnx} for slowing antiprotons for the antimatter factory \cite{Alemany:2019vsk} and the On-Line Isotope Mass Separator 
(ISOLDE) facility for short-lived ions \cite{Catherall_2017}. The world's first proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment is
also at CERN, the Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment (AWAKE) \cite{Awake_201676}. Even in the International
Space Station , CERN's Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) tries to observe dark matter by studying cosmic rays \cite{AGUILAR2002331}. 
The research programme at CERN covers topics from the basic structure of matter 
to cosmic rays, and from the SM to supersymmetry. 

% Closure
\begin{comment}
Important breakthroughs and advances have been done by CERN on three main technical fields: accelerators, detectors and computing.
Behind these three areas of technology, lies a great number of topics of expertise: cryogenics, ultra-high vacuums, particle tracking, 
radiation monitoring, superconductivity, plasma-physics and many more. Probably, the most popular of the contributions is the 
invention of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989 at CERN facilities \cite{Berners-Lee:2639699}. All of this proves the versatility and capability of CERN as
a contributor to science, technology and society.

\label{sec:Chap2:LHC}
% Intro - History
\begin{comment}
In the middle of the 80's, the plans for building the LHC were started.
At several  high-energy physics workshops and conferences, the idea of assembling a machine able to 
reach multi-TeV energies was discussed. This instrument would allow physicists to search for the Higgs
boson at all possible masses. In 1991 the Long-Range Planning Committee of CERN proposed the
construction of the LHC as the best step forward in CERN's future . The approval of
the LHC project arrived in 1994 and in 1995 the Conceptual Design Report was published \cite{Pettersson:291782}. 
 on 10 September 2008, a beam of protons was successfully  directed into the LHC pipes for the first time.
%\footnote{9 days after the start of LHC, several conducting magnets were damaged due to an electrical fault in the bending magnets.
%The LHC was started again in November 2009.}.
\end{comment}
In 1991, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was proposed with the purpose of searching 
for the elusive Higgs boson\cite{LHC_fundations}\cite{Pettersson:291782}. 
Finally, after several years of planning and construction, on September 10  2008, 
a beam of protons was successfully  directed into the LHC pipes for the first time.


A summary of the main parameters of LHC for $\Pproton\Pproton$ collisions 
is presented in Table \ref{tab:Chap2:LHC:Parameters}. These parameters are shown for how
the machine was designed, for Run-1 (2011-2012) and Run-2 (2015-2018) as well as the expected parameters for Run-3 (2022-2025).
The forecasted values for the High Luminosity (HL) LHC upgrade, scheduled post 2027, are povided too.

\subsection{Machine design}
The LHC is a circular hadron accelerator with a circumference of $27\,$km. 
Located within once was the LEP\footnote{LEP is the accelerator used 
by CERN from 1999 to 2000 \cite{Myers226776}} collider tunnel.
The LHC tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site, 
being mainly on french territory. %An overall schematic view of the LHC is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:OverallLHC}.

Circular accelerators are more space-efficient than linear ones due to their ability to speed up 
particles with less physical space. They simultaneously ramp up opposite charge beams with 
a single magnetic field, with bending power given by $p[GeV]=0.3qB$[T]$r$[m], 
where $p$ is momentum, $q$ is particle charge ($q=1$ for protons), $B$ is 
magnetic field, and $r$ is accelerator radius.

%	  \label{fig:Chap2:OverallLHC}
%	\end{figure}

The LHC has two rings with ultra-high vacuum (to prevent collisions with gas molecules 
while moving through the accelerator) in which particle beams travel in opposite directions. 
The design expected to collide proton beams at a centre-of-mass energy (\CM) up to $14\,$TeV at 
 a luminosity (\lumi) of $10^{34}$\lumiunits (see Section \ref{sec:Chap2:LHC:lumi} for details about luminosity). As well as protons, it can collide heavy ions, in particular lead nuclei, 
 at $\CM=2.3\,$TeV per nucleon and a peak luminosity of \mbox{\lumi$=10^{27}$\lumiunits} \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev-nucl-102711-094910}.
These specifications make the LHC the accelerator with higher \CM collision energy \cite{CERN_LHC_web}. 

The beams in the LHC are made up of bunches of protons that are spaced $7\,$m apart and collide every $25\,$ns. 
Each bunch contains around $1.1 \times 10^{11}$  hadrons, being 2556 the maximum possible 
number of bunches that can be reached with the beam preparation method currently used \cite{steerenberg2019operation}.
The size of each bunch is approximately $25\,$cm \cite{Steerenberg:2621245}.


% Tunnels
The LEP tunnel lies between $45\,$m and $170\,$m below the surface on a plane inclined at 1.4\% sloping towards the Léman lake.
The underground construction adds some shielding from outside interferences that could interact with the detectors and cause 
anomalous readings. Even $100\,$m underground, the cosmic rays can reach the detectors, so these are used to help to calibrate them.
The tunnel has an internal diameter of $3.7\,$m, which makes it extremely difficult to install two completely separate proton rings
\cite{Blewett:103798} as in the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Therefore, the counter-rotating rings are built
under the \textit{two-in-one} twin-bore superconducting magnet design. 
These twin bore configurations have the disadvantage of having the rings magnetically coupled, which adversely affects flexibility \cite{Evans_2008}.
Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC:DipoleCS} shows an example of the LHC twin-bore dipole magnet.

  \label{fig:Chap2:LHC:DipoleCS}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

% Lattice Layout and Magnet system
The LHC is not a perfect circle. Approximately $22\,$km of the LHC ring consists of 8 curved sections. 
The remaining $5\,$km of the tunnel are made of 8 straight sections, denominated insertion regions (IR), that provide space for the experiments.
Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC:Layaout} shows the distribution of IR and crossing points for the LHC. This layout follows that
of the LEP tunnel. The number of crossing points  where the beams pass from one ring to the
other for colliding was decreased from the original eight at LEP to four in the LHC in order to reduce costs and 
optimise the utility insertions containing Radio Frequency (RF), the collimation and the
beam dump systems \cite{Pettersson:291782}. 

The arcs contain the dipole bending magnets, which are shown in Section \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC:DipoleCS}.
The 1232 twin-bore magnets curve the trajectory of the particle beam that would, otherwise, follow a straight line.
Dipoles are also equipped with additional multipole lattice magnets (sextupole, octupole and decapole), which correct for small imperfections 
in the magnetic field at the extremities of the dipoles. 

Each of the eight straight sections is approximately $528\,$m long. The RF cavities delivering
$2\,$MV (an accelerating field of $5\,$MV/m) at $400\,$MHz are located in the IR4. 
The 16 RF cavities compensate the synchrotron radiation
losses (the electromagnetic radiation emitted when charged particles travel in curved paths) that
take place at the arcs of LHC.
Since the protons loose much less energy than electrons in a circular collider\footnote{The
energy radiated per particle by synchrotron radiation is proportional to the 
inverse of the mass of the particle: $\Delta E \propto 1/m^4$. }, the LHC would have
profited from more circular sections. However, re-using LEP tunnels was preferred in terms of cost.
During the 20 minutes that are needed to reach the beams maximum energy,
the bunches have passed the RF cavities more than 10 million times \cite{Pettersson:291782}.

The RF cavities (also known as resonators) are metallic chambers spaced at intervals along the accelerator shaped to resonate at 
specific frequencies, allowing radio waves to interact with passing particle bunches. The main role of
the RF cavities is to keep the proton bunches tightly packed to ensure the required luminosity at
the interaction point. They also transfer RF power to the beam to accelerate it to the top energy \cite{Radiofrequency:1997424}.

At the insertion of the arc and straight sections, quadrupole magnets are installed to suppress
the dispersion of particles. Acting as focal lenses, quadrupole magnets gather the particles 
together.  This system not only cancels the horizontal dispersion arising in the arc but also
adapts the LHC reference orbit to the geometry of the LEP tunnel. 
Before entering the detectors, the inner triplets (which are made mostly from quadrupoles)
tighten the beam, from $0.2\times 10^{-3}\,$m  down to $16\times 10^{-6}\,$m. These are known as insertion magnets.

In total there are more than 9000 magnets all over the LHC and more than 50 types of magnets are needed to
 make the particles circulate in their path without losing speed.
The coils are made of niobium-titanium (NbTi)  which is cooled to less than $2\,$K with superfluid helium to reach superconductivity. 

\begin{comment}
Of course, only stable charge particles\footnote{Long-lived particles such as the muon ($\tau \approx 2\times10^{-6}$ s) are discussed to be 
used on a muon collider \cite{Long:2020wfp}.} such as electrons, positrons, protons, antiprotons and some ions, can be accelerated by
the magnetic fields described. The force that experiments a charged particle with charge $q$ moving under a magnetic field $B$ at
a speed $v$ is given by Lorentz law
\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{F} = q \overrightarrow{v} \times \overrightarrow{B}
\end{equation}
and, since $\overrightarrow{B}$ is perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{v}$, this force is always directed to the centre of the circle of radius $r$:  $F = Bqv = m\frac{v^2}{r}$.
\end{comment}


%A proton machine such as LHC does not have the same synchrotron
%radiation problem and would, ideally, have longer arcs and shorter straight sections for the same
%circumference, but accepting the tunnel “as built” was the cost-effective solution. However, it was
%decided to equip only four of the possible eight interaction regions and to suppress beam crossings
%in the other four to prevent unnecessary disruption of the beams.

%      	LHC - Accelerator Complex         %
%%%&&&%%%%%%%%%%%%%	%%%%
\subsection{Accelerator complex}
\label{sec:Chap2:LHC:AcceleratorComplex}
To accelerate the proton beams, the existing CERN accelerator complex is used.
These accelerators were, back in the day, the state of the art colliders and now they serve
as injection system for the LHC. The path followed by the particle beams is presented in
 Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC_AcceleratorComplex}. The accelerator complex consists in
several machines interconnected to boost the beams until these reach the LHC.

The proton bunches are produced ionising a gas of hydrogen atoms and then they are accelerated to a
momentum of 50 MeV by the linear accelerator (LINAC2). %Starting from Run-3, the LINAC2 is being replaced by
%the LINAC4. 
After being produced, the beams enter into the first circular accelerator, the Proton Synchrotron 
Booster (PSB) which has 630 m radius and increases the energy of the protons until 1.4 GeV.

Right after the PSB, the Proton Synchrotron brings the particles $25\,$GeV. 
It is followed by $6.9\,$km long SPS, which raises the energy to 450 GeV. 
Once the protons have 450 GeV, the minimum energy at which the LHC can maintain a stable beam, they
are injected into the LHC by two different $2\,$km-long Transfer Injection (TI) lines \cite{Lari:1069714}. 
Protons will circulate in the LHC for 20 minutes until reaching the nominal beam energy\cite{Evans_2008}.
 
Heavy-ion collisions were included in the conceptual design of the LHC from an early stage and 
follow the same to maximum acceleration as the protons. Lead ions are extracted from a source 
of vaporised lead and initially accelerated by the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR).

\subsection{LHC experiments}
%In the LHC are carried 4 major experiments: ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE. The detectors for these experiments
%are shown in Figure \ref{fig7:Chap2:LHC_experiments}.
%In the 4 interaction points of LHC (described in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC:Layaout}) are located the four detectors. 
%The IR1 and IR5 house the high luminosity experiments of the LHC: ATLAS and CMS respectively. These IR 
%are identical in terms of hardware and optics being the only difference that the crossing-angle is in the vertical plane
%in Point 1 and in the horizontal plane in Point 5 \cite{Evans_2008}. 
%The straight sections of IR2 and IR8, with medium luminosity, host the ion experiment ALICE and LHCb detector.
%Luminosity levelling is usually applied for the two low luminosity experiments in IP2 and IP8.


In the LHC four major experiments are carried, each of them with its own detector (Figure \ref{fig7:Chap2:LHC_experiments})
and physics programme.
%These particle detectors measure particles produced as debris from the $\Pproton \Pproton$ (or lead) collisions through the interaction
%with the material of the sub-detectors. 
Distributed along the collider as is shown in Figures\,\ref{fig:Chap2:LHC_AcceleratorComplex}, 
these highly sophisticated experiments are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS)} \cite{ATLAS:2008xda}:
  		Located in the IR1, it is a generic multi-purpose experiment for high luminosity (up to \lumi = $10^{34}$\lumiunits).
		It studies $\Pproton \Pproton$ collisions and investigates a wide range of physics, from the SM to the search for extra dimensions or
		dark matter. It has the dimensions of a cylinder, $46\,$m long, $25\,$m in diameter. The ATLAS detector weighs $7\times 10^{3}$ tonnes.
		%Similar to the weight of the Eiffel tower
		The design of the ALTAS detector features excellent jet and \MET resolution, particle identification and flavour tagging
		and standalone muon measurements.  A scheme of this detector is shown in Figure \ref{fig7:Chap2:LHC_experiments:ATLAS}.
		ATLAS will be covered in detail in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:ATLAS}.
	
  \item \textbf{Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)} \cite{CMS:2008xjf}: 
  		Built inside the IR5, it's the other general-purpose experiment for high luminosity (same \lumi  as ATLAS). 
		CMS has the same objectives and goals as ATLAS but both its hardware and software designs are different. 
		Even though CMS is smaller than ATLAS ($21\,$m long, $15\,$m in diameter) it is much heavier, weighting  $14\times 10^{3}$ tonnes.
		The bulk of its weight is the steel yoke that confines the $4\,$T magnetic field of its superconducting solenoid.
		%At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding 
		%an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator 
		%sampling hadron calorimeter
		The design of CMS emphasises magnificent electron/photon energy and momentum resolution. 
		Figure \ref{fig7:Chap2:LHC_experiments:CMS} illustrates this device. 
		The role of coexistence of CMS and ATLAS is fundamental so that one can verify and confirm the experiments of the other
		independently. 
		
		
  \item \textbf{Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb)} \cite{LHCb:2008vvz}:
    		Hosted at IR2, it is a lower luminosity experiment designed to study the small asymmetries between matter and antimatter through \CP violation using rare decays
		of \Pbottom-quark based hadrons. 
		The detector is arranged as a succession of planar sub-detectors (as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig7:Chap2:LHC_experiments:LHCb})
		since most of the \Pbottom-flavoured mesons follow the beam pipe direction
		when created in the $\Pproton \Pproton$ collision. LHCb delivers remarkable low-momentum track reconstruction and particle identification. 

  \item \textbf{A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE)} \cite{ALICE_Collaboration_2008}:
  		It is a low luminosity experiment in IR8 that focuses on QCD.%, the strong-interaction sector of the SM. 
		The main feature of ALICE is a  general-purpose detector that it uses heavy-ion collisions to 
		 study matter interacting at extreme densities and temperatures, thus reproducing the quark-gluon plasma.
		 This detector is shown in Figure \ref{fig7:Chap2:LHC_experiments:ALICE} and it provides highly efficient 
		 track reconstruction in an environment full of heavy ions.
		 Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy collisions and a dedicated proton-nucleus run.

\subsection{LHC computing grid}
\label{sec:Chap2:LHC:LCG}
The data collected by the different LHC experiments is stored, processed and, then, made available for all the researchers of each collaboration\footnote{Within the grid context, 
each collaboration is known as Virtual Organisation (VO).}.
This is possible thanks to the last piece of the LHC, its computing model and infrastructure: the LHC Computing Grid (LCG). It consists
of several computing farms distributed around the world and interconnected. Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC_Grid} shows the geographical distribution of the different facilities that comprise the LCG.
Just as the WWW enables access to information, the Grid enables access to computer resources. Employing a grid certificate, is possible for any user to run jobs
on the grid and to access the data stored. The implementation of the grid model implies an effective coordination among all LHC collaboration centres \cite{Bird:2005js}.

	\end{figure}

Different types of computing centres have been defined and classified in Tiers \cite{Duckeck:2005rb}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Tier-0}: This facility is located at CERN and it is responsible for archiving (first copy) and distributing the raw data received from the Event Filter, i.e., 
				the data emerging from the Data Acquisition systems (DAQ) after the trigger.
				It provides prompt reconstruction and distributes a copy of the raw data to the Tier-1 centres.
				%	RAW	:	Raw data				-->   Events as output by the Event Filter
				% Derived datasets: ESD, primary AOD and TAG set.
				%	ESD :	 Event Summary Data  	-->  Event data written as the output of the reconstruction process
				%     AOD	:	 Analysis Object Data	-->  A reduced event representation, derived from ESD, suitable for analysis
				%.    TAG	: 	 Tag Data		      		-->  Event-level metadata  to support efficient identification and selection of events of interest to a given analysis
	\item \textbf{Tier-1}: These facilities archive the raw data permanently and provide the computational capacity for reprocessing and for physical
				analysis. It also stores the simulated and reprocessed data.  Currently, there are thirteen large computer centres serving as Tier-1 (see Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC_GridTier}).
				These make data available to their Tier-2 centres \cite{CERN_LHCG_centres}.
				% modest RAW and ESD
	\item \textbf{Tier-2}:  Typically located at universities and other scientific institutes, there are more than 150 Tier-2 sites. The derived datasets produced by the physics groups 
				are copied to the Tier-2 facilities for further analysis. The MC simulations for event production are executed at this level.
	\item \textbf{Tier-3}: The local computing resources, from local clusters to even just an individual PC are referred to as Tier-3. There is no formal 
				engagement between worldwide LCG and the Tier-3.
\end{itemize}

This system provides near real-time access to LHC data. The LCG collaboration spreads out over 42 countries with 170 computing centres and 1 million computer cores, being the world's largest computer grid. 
It deals with  over two million tasks daily. These specifications make the LCG the most sophisticated system for data taking and analysis ever built for science.

\section{ATLAS}
\label{sec:Chap2:ATLAS}


Installed in its experimental cavern at point 1, ATLAS is the largest detector ever constructed for a particle collider with its 
$46\,$m long and $25\,$m in diameter. It is designed to record events of high-energy colliding particles at high luminosities.
The thousands of millions of interactions that take place at the centre of the ATLAS detector are recorded and processed by the
different sub-detectors, which are composed by more than 100 million sensitive electronic channels. Each ATLAS sub-detector
is sensitive to a different type of particle and to different properties. Therefore, the layered structure allows for effective particle identification, as well as  
enables accurate measurements of energy and momentum. Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:GeneralOverview} shows an overall layout of the ATLAS 
detector and identifies its different sub-detectors. In the picture can be appreciated that the cylindrical shape of ATLAS is divided into two parts: the ``barrel'' 
and the two ``end-caps'' . In the barrel region, the sub-detectors are built as coaxial layers around the beam pipe. %(see meme \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Shrek}).
As one moves away from the axis, it finds the Inner Detector (ID), the solenoid magnet, the Electromagnetic (ECAL) and Hadronic (HCAL) Calorimeters,
and the Muon Spectrometer (MS) in the outermost layer. 
The technical details of these sub-detectors and the magnet system are presented in Sections\,\ref{sec:Chap2:ID}, 
\ref{sec:Chap2:CALO}, \ref{sec:Chap2:ATLAS:MS} and \ref{sec:Chap2:MagnetSystem}.

 ATLAS is able to explore a wide range of phenomena with high precision. Even though it is
 a general-purpose experiment, it was designed taking into account the Higgs and BSM pheomena searches that were carried out at LHC. This is
 why, since the mass of the Higgs was not known at that time, its performance requirements cover a large mass range for
 the Higgs decay products.

 
 \begin{comment}
 The stone for the foundations of ATLAS was laid in March 1992 at the critical ‘Towards the LHC Experimental Programme’ 
 meeting, where physicists proposed several possible experiments for the LHC \cite{LHC_CernCouncil_Experiments}. Two 
 projects based on large toroidal magnet systems were proposed EAGLE and ASCOT. % \cite{Norton:1076511}.
  By the summer of that year, both experiments merged into ATLAS. In October 1992, the letter of intent of the ATLAS
 Collaboration was sent to the LHC Experiments committee and, in 1994, the technical proposal \cite{ATLAS_TechnicalProposal}.
 In 1997 the formal approval of the ATLAS experiment arrived and one year later the excavation on the cavern began.
 The cavern was inaugurated five years later and the construction of the ATLAS detector ended in 2008.  Later, in 2009, at
 $\CM = 2.36\,$TeV, ATLAS records its first collisions \cite{collaboration:1228300}. 
\end{comment}
 
 %One of the most important milestones for ATLAS (and for all science in the last decades) was the observation of a particle %(see \ref{sec:Chap1:HiggsPhys_discovery})
 %consistent with the Higgs boson in July 2012.  In 2016,  the combination of
 %ATLAS and CMS measurements for Higgs boson production on decay rates with Run-1 data was published \cite{ATLAS:2016neq}.
 %After that, the physics programme at $13\,$TeV allowed precision studies of the Higgs boson and other SM particles, as well as the 
 %search for new particles with other masses. 
 
 As already described in Section \ref{sec:Chap1:HiggsPhys_discovery}, the Higgs boson was discovered on 2012.
 This is the most important milestones for ATLAS (and for all science in the last decades).
 Other relevant items in ATLAS timeline are the observation and rate measurement of \ttbar events \cite{ATLAS:2010zaw} or
 the evidence for rare electroweak $\PWpm\PWpm$ production \cite{ATLAS:2014jzl}. The first evidence of light-by-light scattering 
 at high energy was also found with ATLAS \cite{ATLAS:2017fur}. The first \ttH associate production \cite{ATLAS:2017fak} and 
 $\PHiggs \rightarrow \Pbottom \APbottom$ decays \cite{ATLAS:2018kot} were observed for first time by ATLAS too.

%        Coordinate system    %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Coordinate system}
\label{sec:Chap2:ATLAS:CoordinateSystem}
Due to its cylindrical structure, ATLAS uses a right-handed system with its origin at the IP where the collisions take place. 
On one side, there are the (\textit{x, y, z}) cartesian coordinates. The \textit{x}-axis is pointing towards the centre of the ring 
circumference, the \textit{y}-axis is perpendicular to the plane defined by the LHC ring and it points to the surface, and the \textit{z}-axis
is defined by the direction of the beam. 
On the other side, it is more frequent to employ the cylindrical coordinates $(r, \phi, z)$ or the system defined by the azimuthal angle ($\phi$)
and the pseudorapidity ($\eta$):

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
	\eta &= -\textrm{ln}  \left[ \textrm{tan} \left( \frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right]
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
  \centering
 	 \includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{Chapter2/Pseudorapidity2}
\end{minipage}

where $\theta$ is the polar angle\footnote{Defined as the angle between the particle three-momentum, $\overrightarrow{p}$ and the positive direction of the beam axis.}.  
As the polar angle approaches zero, pseudorapidity tends towards infinity.
The change in pseudorapidity $\Delta \eta$ is Lorentz invariant under boosts along the beam axis.
%The use of $\eta$ is preferred over $\theta$ because the distribution of events typically looks flat with respect to $\eta$.
In terms of the momentum, the above equation can be expressed as:
\begin{equation*}
	\eta = -\textrm{ln} \left( \frac{|\overrightarrow{p}| + p_z}{|\overrightarrow{p}| - p_z}\right) 
\end{equation*}
being $p_z$ the momentum along the beam direction.
The rapidity ($y$) is used when dealing with massive particles and it can be expressed 
as $y = \frac{1}{2}log[(E+p_{z})/(E-p_{z})]$, being $E$ the energy of the particle.
%the energy projection of the momentum in the \textit{z}-axis. 
Note that when the particles approach the speed of light, 
they are in the limit $E \approx |\overrightarrow{p}|$ and the values for rapidity and 
pseudorapidity converge.
The angular distance is measured in units of $\dR = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^{2}+(\Delta \phi)^{2}}$, which is invariant under a boost along the 
\textit{z}-axis\footnote{The $\Delta R$ is measured between to vectors, therefore, $\Delta \eta = \eta_2 - \eta_1$ and $\Delta \phi = \phi_2 - \phi_1$.}.
Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:CoordinateSystem} shows the coordinate system of ATLAS for both cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
 	 \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{Chapter2/ATLAS_CoordinateSystem}
	 \caption{Coordinate system of the ATLAS detector. Tunnel center refers to the centre of the
	 circumference  drawn by the LHC.}
	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:CoordinateSystem}
\end{figure}

The transverse magnitudes such as the transverse momentum (\pT) and transverse energy (\ET) are defined in the $x$-$y$ plane. 
Knowing the \pT, and the $\eta$ and $\phi$ angles, the cartesian momentum $(p_{x} , p_{y} , p_{z})$ can be derived from:
\begin{align*}
	p_x &= \pT \textrm{ cos}(\phi) 	&&  	p_y= \pT \textrm{ sin}(\phi) \\
	p_z &= \pT \textrm{ sinh}(\phi) 	&& 	|\overrightarrow{p}|= \pT \textrm{ cosh}(\phi)
\end{align*}
\pablo{Maybe remove the comment about how $(p_{x} , p_{y} , p_{z})$ can be derived.}

\subsection{Inner Detector}
\label{sec:Chap2:ID}
The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID)  \cite{CERN-LHCC-97-016}\cite{ATLAS:2010ylv}\cite{ATLAS:2008xda} is the closest sub-detector to the beam pipe.
Its layout is shown in Figures \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_Barel} and \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_Endcap}. 
The charged particles follow a curved trajectory inside the ID due to the magnetic field of the ATLAS 
bending magnet (described in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:MagnetSystem}). The different pieces that
comprise the ID record the hits that are later used  to reconstruct the traces of these particles 
with great accuracy allowing, thus, to measure its momentum 
(this is done using the sagitta method described in Section \ref{sec:Chap3:Reco:Sagitta}).
For particles coming from the interaction point (IP), the geometric acceptance of the ID is 
$|\eta| < 2.5$ for pseudorapidity. % and full $\phi$ coverage in the azimuthal angle.
The ID provides $\pT$ resolution\footnote{Typically the momentum-measurement precision ($\sigma_{\pT}$) 
relative to the \pT is used.  The relative resolution degrades with higher \pT.}  
of approximately $\sigma_{\pT} / \pT = 0.05\% \oplus 1\%$\footnote{The $\oplus$ symbol means that the 
relative uncertainties are summed in quadrature.}.
% and a transverse impact parameter resolution\footnote{The impact parameter determine the distance of a reconstructed track from a charged particle to the perigee (the closest point of the track to the global $z$-axis)}
% of 10 \textmu m for particles in the central $\eta$ region. 
It is designed to provide excellent momentum resolution, pattern recognition and measurements of both primary and secondary vertex
for charged particles above the $\pT$ threshold (nominally 0.5 GeV).

\begin{figure}

	 \caption{Barrel part of ID of the ATLAS experiment with the Pixel, SCT and TRT sub-detectors. The IBL is not shown here.}
	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_Barel}
\end{figure}

The ID is composed of four sub-detectors: The Insertable B-Layer (IBL), the Pixel Detector, 
the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) and the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). 
The different sub-systems are respectively described in Sections \ref{sec:Chap2:ID:B-Layer},
 \ref{sec:Chap2:ID:Pixel}, \ref{sec:Chap2:ID:SCT} and \ref{sec:Chap2:ID:TRT}.

%\end{wrapfigure} 
Depending on the $\eta$ that a particle has, it will interact with some elements of the detector.
Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_Endcap} shows the end-cap elements transversed by
two charged particles with $\eta = 2.2$ and $1.4$. The track with $\eta = 1.4$ traveses first the beryllium beam-pipe, then the three
cylindrical silicon pixels and the four disks with double layers of the SCT. Finally, this particle travels across approximately 40 tubes
in the TRT wheels. In contrast, the particle with $\eta = 2.2$ encounter the first of the cylindrical silicon-pixel layers after leaving
the beryllium pipe. Then, the two end-cap pixel disks and the four last disks of the end-cap SCT.

% Silicon semiconductors
\paragraph{Silicon semiconductors}\mbox{}\\
When a charged particle traverses a doped silicon semiconductor, it creates a pair electron-hole by ionisation.
An electric field is applied to the active part of the detector module so that the electron drifts in oposite direction
of the electric field and the hole in the field direction. Then, both charges are collected by the p-n junctions. 
The silicon sensors can be shaped either as pixels, providing precies 2D space point, or as strips, giving
a single dimension positioning.
On the order of $10^5$ electron-hole pairs are liberated when a particle crosses the silicon wafer and, with 
appropriate electronics, a clear signal is obtained in the pixel or strip in which the charged was collected.

\subsubsection{Insertable B-Layer}
\label{sec:Chap2:ID:B-Layer}
The IBL \cite{Capeans:1291633} is the innermost component of the ID. It is located between the beam pipe and
the Pixel Detector.  Added after Run-1, it provides the closest-to-IP measurements. This improves the robustness 
and performance of the ATLAS tracking system. It plays a fundamental role for \btag
efficiency because this tagging relies on precise vertex reconstruction. The IBL provides redundancy in the measurements 
of tracks in order to control the fake rate arising from random combinations of clusters in events with a high pile-up background.

With a hit resolution of $8\,\mu$m in $r$-$\phi$ and $40\,\mu$m along $z$, the IBL covers the $|\eta| < 2.7$ and the entire $\phi$ range.

The barrel structure if the IBL has a radius of $3.3\,$cm and is composed by 14 carbon fibre 
staves as it is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_IBL}.
Each stave has incorporated cooling CO$_2$ circuits and contains 20 modules.
They use two types of photodetectors: ATLAS pixel planar sensors and 3D pixel sensors \cite{LaRosa:2016nbd}.. 
%The used pixels have a size of $50 \times 400$ \textmu m$^{2}$  %, providing a resolution of the order of 100 \textmu m. 
Due to the high luminosity of the LHC, the IBL is built with radiation-tolerant sensors.

	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_IBL}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pixel Detector}
\label{sec:Chap2:ID:Pixel}
The ATLAS Pixel Detector \cite{CERN-LHCC-2017-021} is made up of four layers of silicon pixels 
of $50 \times 400$ \textmu m$^{2}$ organised in modules. The modules are arranged in three cylinders
concentric to the beam axis\footnote{The cylinders concentric to axis along beam the beam are referred as the barrel.} 
and three concentric disks at both ends of the barrel as Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_PixelDetector} shows.
As well as the IBL, it aims to reconstruct the trajectories of the particles traversing it.
It provides a full coverage of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ and a pseudorapidity range of  $|\eta| < 2.5$ as well as
a resolution of $10\,\mu$m in $r$-$\phi$ and $115\,\mu$m in the $z$-axis.

The Pixel Detector and the IBL combined contain $92 \times 10^6$ pixels with its respective electronic channels, which
cover an area of approximately $1.9\,$m$^2$ of silicon consuming $15\,$kW.
The barrel region consists of four concentric layers equipped with 1736 sensor modules and each 
of the two end-caps has three disks with 2888 modules \cite{ATLAS_Web_Detectors}. Figure
\ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_PixelModule} shows the assembly view and cross section of a module of the ATALS 
ID Pixel Detector. Each of these modules consists on a silicon pixel sensor bonded to the front-end electronic chips.

%Hits in a pixel are read out if the signal exceeds a tunable threshold. The pulse height is measured using 
%the Time-over-Threshold (ToT) technique.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
 	 \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{Chapter2/ATLAS_ID_2_PixelDectector}
	 \caption{Schematic view of the ATLAS Pixel Detector consisting of individual barrel and end-cap layers \cite{ATLAS:2008xda}.}
	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_PixelDetector}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Semiconductor Tracker}
\label{sec:Chap2:ID:SCT}
The SCT consists of 4088 modules tiling four coaxial cylindrical layers in the barrel region and two end-caps each containing nine disk
layers, all of this surrounding the Pixel Detector and providing additional precision tracking.  The main difference with the Pixel Detector
is that the SCT uses microstrip sensor technology. A microstrip is very similar to a pixel but much larger length ($6\,$cm) in one direction. 
The reason to use microstrips instead of pixels is that the strips are more cost-effective than traditional pixels and a 
good spatial resolution can be obtained as well if the strips are arranged with an angular offset. Therefore, each SCT detector 
unit consists on two back-to-back silicon-microstrip planes with a relative angle of $40\,$mrad.
Eight strip layers (i.e. four space points) are crossed by each track in the SCT providing valuable tracking information with resolution of 
$17\,\mu$m in $r$-$\phi$ and $580\,\mu$m in the $z$ coordinate. The SCT covers the entire $\phi$ range and up to 2.5 in $\eta$.

Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ID_SCT} shows an exploded view of the different components of an SCT module, including 
the high termal conductivity spine, the polyimide hybrids and readout chips.

\subsubsection{Transition Radiation Tracker}
\label{sec:Chap2:ID:TRT}
The TRT is used in conjunction with the Pixel Detector and silicon micro strip (SCT) to extend 
the $\eta$ range in which the tracks can be reconstructed up to $|\eta| = 2$. This part of the ID 
is formed by a 50000 straw tubes with  $4\,$mm diameter filled with gas.
 The TRT relies both on the collection of primary ionisation charge and the collection of secondary ionisation charge arising 
 from the transition radiation to measure the  track of charged particles. 
 The tube surface functions as a cathode while the wire in the center as a cathode. When a charged particle passes through the gas in 
 the tube, it ionises the gas and the freed electrons drift towards the anode, generating an electrical current. This detector provides 
 a single hit resolution of $170\,\mu$m in $r$-$\phi$ but does not have sensitivity in $z$.
%resolution of 130 μ m
The TRT also provides discrimination between electrons and pions since the later generate a much smaller signal than the former. When the electrons pass, they produce
x-ray photons that lead to strong avalanches within the tubes and, thus, a great signal.

\subsection{Calorimeters}
\label{sec:Chap2:CALO}
After the ID, the next layer of detectors in ATLAS correspond to the calorimeters (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Calorimeters}) \cite{Cavallari_2011}. 
Their purpose is to measure the energy of the particles 
(neutral or charged), as well as to help to reconstruct the path followed by them. 
Most particles initiate a shower (Section \ref{sec:Chap2:CALO:Shower}) when they enter into the calorimeter. Part of the energy 
of these particles is deposited in the device, collected and measured by it.
Most of calorimeters in particle physics are segmented transversely to provide information about the direction of the particles.
Based on the shower shape, the longitudinal segmentation provides information for particle identification.
(a more detailed discussion is presented in Chapter \ref{chap:ObjectReconstuction}). 

In general, calorimeters can be classified as sampling, when are made of two types of materials, 
or homogeneous, built with just one type of material.
Both ATLAS calorimeters are sampling, which consist of alternating layers of different materials:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Passive material}: Also known as absorber, it is a denser material to full stop the traversing particles.
		When a particle interacts with the passive material it produces the shower (Figures \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:PShoweringSim} 
		and \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:PShowering}).
		For the absorber layers in ATLAS, lead is used for the ECAL and steel for the HCAL.
	\item \textbf{Active material}: This material detects the particles from the shower originated in the absorber.
		The liquid Argon (LAr) is used as active material for ECAL and plastic scintillator for HCAL.
\end{itemize}
In the homogeneous calorimeters, the material used combines the features of an absorber and a detector, performing both tasks.

There are two main types of calorimeters depending of the type of particle that its desired to detect: 
the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), which measures the energy of electrons/positrons and photons, 
and the hadronic calorimeters (HCAL), which registers the energy of the strongly-interacting particles. 
%Both classes are covered in the next sections.

	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Calorimeters}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Scintillator}\mbox{}\\
The particles from the shower leave some of the molecules of the plastic scintillator in an excited state. The 
subsequent decay of these molecules produces the emission of photons in the ultraviolet energy region.
This light is collected by photomultiplier tubes at the edge of the of the tiles
and converted into a current pulse whose amplitude is proportional
to the energy deposited by transversing particle.
\pablo{Maybe I could delete this paragraph about scintillators. In principle I don't wish to.}



%The plastic scintillators turn the particles that the shower
 %originated in the steel layer into photons, which are converted into an electric current whose intensity is proportional to the original particle's intensity

\subsubsection{Particle showering}
\label{sec:Chap2:CALO:Shower}

\pablo{The whole Section \ref{sec:Chap2:CALO:Shower} could be removed but I rather not.}

A particle shower is a cascade of secondary particles produced when a high-energy particle interacts with matter.
The first particle interacts with the passive material producing a secondary particle with less energy than the first one.
The second particle
does the same and, in each step, the particles produced are less and less energetic. For a single incoming particle, 
this process can continue for thousands of iterations \cite{grupen_shwartz_2008}. An illustration of the
EM and hadronic particle cascades is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:PShoweringSim}.

	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:PShowering}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Electromagnetic shower}\mbox{}\\
The electromagnetic (EM) shower is initiated by a $\Pelectron$, $\APelectron$ or  $\Pphoton$, these three particles are the sole components of this type of shower.
At energies higher than 100 MeV, the EM showering is based on two main processes: bremsstrahlung and pair production.
The electrons lose their energy almost exclusively by bremsstrahlung radiation, a process in which the lepton radiates thousands of soft photons because of its
interaction with another charged particle.
The photons lose their energy by the production of an $\Pelectron$$\APelectron$ pair.
At lower energy scales, other processes contribute. In the MeV range, the Compton scattering\footnote{Scattering of a photon after interacting with a charged particle, usually an electron.}
and photoelectric effect\footnote{Emission of photoelectrons when the EM radiation interacts with matter.} are the dominant interactions for energy loss
for photons, while the ionisation and excitation are for the charged particles ($\Pelectron$ and $\APelectron$).


\paragraph{Hadronic shower}\mbox{}\\
When a hadron interacts with the passive material, this shower is initialised. % and it always has an EM component too. 
Both strong and EM interactions are involved in the development of this type of shower and 
they present a larger variety of particle components. Therefore, the hadronic showers are significantly more 
complex than the EM. Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:PShowering} shows the processes leading to a hadronic cascade.

The production of neutral pions represents about a third of the energy loss of hadronic interactions. These pions 
decay 98.8\% of times to two photons \cite{pdgPi0} that are starting the EM showers. The rest of hadronic interactions
consist of the production of charged mesons, nuclear fragments and protons, and soft neutrons and photons.
loss through undetectable processes.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%         Electric calorimeter        %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Electromagnetic calorimeter}
\label{sec:Chap2:CALO:ECAL}
The ECAL \cite{Cavallari_2011} absorbs the energy of the $\Pelectron$, $\APelectron$ or a $\Pphoton$ covering a pseudorapidity range 
of $|\eta|<1.475$ in the barrel. It is made of a lead absorber and LAr detector following an accordion shape, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:ECal},
where the different layers are clearly visible. 
The shower originated at the absorber layer ionise the LAr producing a measurable current proportional to the energy of the original particle. 
The LAr layer operates at 87 K.

The barrel part is split into two identical half-barrels separated by a small gap at $z=0$. 
Each end-cap calorimeter is composed of two coaxial wheels that cover $|\eta|<1.475$. 

The total amount of material in the ECAL corresponds to 25-35 radiation lengths, $X_0$, and 2-4 nuclear interaction 
lengths, $\lambda$, over the entire $\eta$ range. The ration length is characteristic of each material and corresponds mean distance 
over which a high-energy electron lose its energy by a factor $e$ due to bremsstrahlung. %The radiation length is the mean free
%path between interactions required to reduce the number of relativistic charged particles by the factor $1/e = 0.37$ as 
%they pass through matter. 

The energy resolution of a calorimeter can be parametrised as:
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\sigma_E}{E}= \frac{a}{\sqrt{E}} \oplus \frac{b}{E} \oplus c 
\end{equation*}
Where $a$ is the stochastic term, $b$ the electronic noise and $c$ a constant that includes detector instabilities and
misscalibrations. The stochastic term tconsiders the statistical fluctuations in the shower detection. This term
is larger for sampling calorimeters, such us the ones in ATLAS, than for the homogeneous ones. The effect of $a$ diminishes with
increasing energy \cite{TarekAbouelfadlMohamed2020}. The noise component $b$ of energy resolution arises from the readout chain's
noise and varies with detector technique and readout circuit properties (e.g., detector capacitance, cables). The noise contribution 
also increases with decreasing energy of the incident particles. Finally, the constant term does not involve energy-dependent 
contributions and originates mainly from instrumental effects that cause variations in calorimeter response.
For the ECAL, the resolution is:
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\sigma_E}{E} = \frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E}} \oplus \frac{170\textrm{ MeV}}{E} \oplus 0.7 \% \,.
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Hadronic calorimeter}
\label{sec:Chap2:CALO:HCAL}
The ATLAS HCAL \cite{Cavallari_2011} is made of a sampling calorimeter of steel and plastic 
scintillator tiles covering the pseudorapidity region of $|\eta|<1.7$ in the barrels. The end-caps 
are made of copper and LAr, covering $1.5<|\eta|<3.2$, and are embedded in the end-caps of the ECAL.
 This calorimeter uses 9800 electronic channels in the barrel and 5600 in the end-cap. With 2900 tones, the HCAL is the heaviest part
 of the ATLAS detector. It has 420000 scintillator tiles and 9500 photomultiplier tubes \cite{ATLAS_Web_Detectors}. 
 These elements are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:HCal}, where the tiles, the fibres and the photomultipliers are visible.
 
 The contribution of the electronic noise is negligible for the tile calorimeter, therefore, its energy resolution only has
 the stochastic and constant terms \cite{Cavallari_2011}:
 \begin{equation*}
	\frac{\sigma_E}{E}=  \frac{5.9\%}{\sqrt{E}} \oplus 5.7 \%
\end{equation*}

%         Forward calorimeter        %

\subsubsection{Forward calorimeter}
In addition to the ECAL and HCAL, a smaller calorimeter is placed in the end-caps surrounding 
the beam pipe in order to cover the forward region ($3.1<|\eta|<4.9$), the forward calorimeter (FCAL). 
This coverage is required for many physics tasks such as the reconstruction of the \MET of the forward-jet tagging.

This calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter based on LAr as active medium and copper as absorber. 
The thickness of the FCAL is optimised to achieve high absorption, approximately, 10 $X_0$ \cite{TarekAbouelfadlMohamed2020}.

This detector has a resolution of:
 \begin{equation*}
	\frac{\sigma_E}{E}=  \frac{100\%}{\sqrt{e}} \oplus 10 \%

The muons penetrate through calorimeters and reach the last layer of the ATLAS detector, the MS \cite{ATLAS:1997ad}. %This system is responsable for muon measurements.

% Magnet system of the MS
The MS surrounds the calorimeters and its aim is to  measure the trajectories of muons 
to determine their direction and momentum with excellent tracking precision
as well as their electric charge in a pseudorapidity coverage of $|\eta| < 2.7$. 
To bend the particle tracks after they exit the HCAL, the MS uses eight large 
superconducting air-core toroid magnets in $|\eta| < 1.4$ region.
For the $1.6 < |\eta| < 2.7$, the tracks are bent by magnets inserted in the end-caps. 
In the transition region, $1.4 < |\eta| < 1.6$, the magnetic field responsible of bending
the particles is provided by both the air-core toroid magnets and the smaller end-cap magnets. 
These fields are perpendicular to the trajectory of the muons originated in the IP. More details 
about the magnet systems of the MS can be found in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:MagnetSystem}.


% Sub-detectors of the MS
The MS instrumentation is based, on one hand, on precision chambers for the coordinate measurements in the bending plane: 
Monitored Drift Tube chambers (MDT) and Cathode-Strip Chambers (CSC), and, on the other hand, on trigger chambers:
Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC). In Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:MS:Scheme} these components
are shown.

\subsection{Magnet system}
\label{sec:Chap2:MagnetSystem}

%The ATLAS Barrel Toroid is the world's largest superconducting magnet. It works along the two end-cap Toroids and a 
%central eight Solenoid magnet to bend the paths of charged particles produced at collisions in the LHC. 
 
The curvature in the track of the particles is fundamental to measure the transverse momentum and the charge of the particles.
To bend the path of charged particles, these are immersed in a homogeneous magnetic field which is produced by the 
both the toroidal and solenoid magnets.
The bending power is proportional to $\int B dl$, where $B$ is the magnetic field component orthogonal to the charged direction.


ATLAS magnetic system is divided into three subsystems: the central solenoid magnet, the barrel toroids (BT) and the end-cap toroid (ECT).

% Central solenoid magnet
\subsubsection{Central solenoid magnet}
The ATLAS solenoid surrounds the ID  providing a $2\,$T magnetic at the centre of the tracking volume. 
This magnet is very thin, having only $4.5\,$cm thickness, which 
minimises the interaction of the particles with the magnet material. It is important to not use a lot 
of material here because, otherwise, the interaction of the particles with
the solenoid magnet would impact negatively in the performance of the calorimeters.
To achieve such a field within a small thickness, $9\,$km of niobium-titanium superconductor wires 
into strengthened, pure aluminium strips  and cooled down to $4.5\,$K are used.
The central solenoid magnet has a cylindrical shape with a diameter of $5.6\,$m and a length of $2.56\,$m, and it weights $5\,$tonnes.

% Toroid magnets
\subsubsection{Toroid magnets}
Three large air-core toroids (one barrel and two end-caps) generate the magnetic field in the MS. %The
%magnetic field provided by the toroid magnets is $3.5\,$T. 
Each toroid consists of eight coils assembled with cylindrical symmetry (see the yellow elements in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:MS}).
The coils are based on an aluminium stabilised niobium-titanium alloy (Al/NbTi/Cu) superconductor operating
at $4.5\,$K \cite{CERN-LHCC-97-018}.% The main difference between the barrel and end-cap toroids for the cold mass is that the latter has a higher critical
%current and less aluminium than the former \cite{CERN-LHCC-97-018}.


\paragraph{Barrel Toroid} \mbox{}\\
The Barrel Toroid magnet is the largest component of the ATLAS magnet system.  It generates a toroidal magnetic field which,
as introduced in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:ATLAS:MS},  is almost completely perpendicular to the track of the particles. 
In order to minimise the impact (i.e. reduce any interaction apart from applying magnetic field) of the magnet system with the particles, 
the barrel toroid is designed as an open and light structure.
The barrel toroid coils are housed in eight individual cryostats, with the linking elements
between them providing the overall mechanical stability. A view of the coils of the barrel toroid in their cryostats is in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Magnet:BarrelToroid}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{Chapter2/ATLAS_Magnets_BarrelToroid}
	\caption{Picture of the installation ATLAS calorimeters. The eight coils that compose the ATLAS barrel toroid magnets are already installed in the cryostats.
	Thus view is one of the most iconic of the ATLAS detector.}
	\label{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Magnet:BarrelToroid}
\end{figure}

The magnetic flux density delivered by this magnet is $3.9\,$T on the superconductor.
For the toroid barrel, the bending power ($\int B dl$) is in the interval $1.5\,$Tm to $5.5\,$Tm in $0 <|\eta| <1.4$.
It is the largest toroidal magnet ever built ($25.3\,$m in length), being probably the most iconic and characteristic element of ATLAS. It
weights 830 tonnes and uses more than $56\,$km of superconducting wire \cite{ATLAS_Web_Detectors}.

\paragraph{End-cap Toroid} \mbox{}\\
The end-caps extend the magnetic field of the barrel toroid to the beam pipe. These magnets are constrained by the 
inner radius of the barrel toroid and the axial length of the experiment.
 
As well as in the barrel toroid, it has a $4.1\,$T magnetic field on the superconductor.
 For the end-cap toroid, the $\int B dl \in [4,\, 8]\,$ Tm in the pseudorapidity range $1.6 <|\eta| < 2.7$ \cite{CERN-LHCC-97-018}.
 In the transition region where the end-cap and barrel toroids overlap ($1.4 <|\eta| <1.6$), the bending power is lower.
 Each end-cap magnet (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Magnet:EndCapToroid}) has a diameter $10.7\;$m and weights $240\,$tonnes \cite{ATLAS_Web_Detectors}.

%         Trigger and DAQ         %   TDAQ
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Trigger and Data Acquisition System}
\label{sec:Chap2:Trigger_and_DAQ}
The proton bunches cross at the center of the ATLAS detector $40\,$million times per second, resulting in approximately (using Run-2 mean pile-up <$\mu$>$=33.7$)
 $1\,200\,$million proton collisions per second. 
 %Even though the bunches are composed by $\sim 10^{11}\,$, there are only around $30\,$collisions per crossing with nominal beam currents.
Reading out and storing all the information from this interactions is not feasible since it has a combined data volume of more than 60 million megabytes per second.
Only some of these events are of interest to physics studies and, consequently, only this subset need to be saved into permanent storage for later analysis.
In order to select only interesting data, ATLAS uses a complex and highly distributed Trigger and Data Acquisition System (TDAQ) 
\cite{ATLAS:2003aa} that reduces the rate of 
recorded data from the initial $1\,200\,$MHz of interactions to just an average of $1\,$kHz. The reduction through the trigger is carried in two steps: 
The electronic performs an initial selection and, afterwards, a large computer farm analyses the data that pass the initial filter. 


%The TDAQ system is an essential component of ATLAS in charge of processing the events online, selecting the relevant ones and storying them.
To do so, the TDAQ verifies for each bunch crossing if at least one among the hundred conditions is satisfied. 
These conditions, also known as ``triggers'', are based on identifying both combinations of candidate physics objects (``signatures'') % Physics objects such as: electrons, photons muons, jets, jets with b-flavour tagging
and global properties of the events \cite{ATLAS:2012nks}. % Global event properties such as MET or HT
Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:ATLAS:Trigger} shows a diagram of the TDAQ system, in this figure can be seen the different components 
as well as the detector read-out and data flow.

%\subsubsection{Level 1 Trigger}
The first-level trigger (L1) is a hardware-based filter performed by ATLAS sub-detectors. The L1 uses the information of the Calorimeters and the MS %(but not the ID)
to select events up to the maximum-readout reate of the detector ($100\,$kHz) within a latency of $2.5\,\mu$s. 
% L1 can filter events ase in:
%	Event-level quantities: the total energyin the calorimeter)
%	Multiplicity of objects above thresholds: the transverse momentum of a muon, etc.
%	Topological requirements: invariant masses or angular distances)
Additionally, the L1 identify the regions of interest (RoI), which includes the position and the \pT of the candidate objects.

For each event accepted by the L1, the Front-End (FE) detector electronics read the detectors data and pass it to the ReadOut Drivers (ROD).
The ROD performs the initial processing and formatting and the ReadOut Systems (ROS) buffers  this data. 

%\subsubsection{High Level Trigger}
The data from the different sub-detectors is sent from the ROS to the software-based trigger, 
the so called ``High Level Trigger'' (HLT), when is requested by the HLT \cite{ATLAS:2003aa}.
This software-based system is executed on a farm of computers (using about $40\,000$ CPU cores). 
Making use of fast-trigger algorithms, it provides early rejection that are followed by more precise
algorithms that relay on Athena.

An average $1.2\,$kHz output rare for Run-2 pass the HLT (with a latency of just $200\,\mu$s) and is sent by the Sub-Farm Output (SFO)
to the Tier-0 facilities for permanent storage and later offline physics analysis.  %It is important to highlight that
the decisions performed by trigger about whether or not to store an event are irrevocable. %If an event does not pass the trigger requirements, 
%it is not stored.%lost forever.

%\subsection{ATLAS upgrade towards HL-LHC}
\begin{comment}
The LHC Run-3 started on April of this year \pablo{(esto está escrito en marzo, así que habrá que ver si es verdad)}. This is the
las data-taking period of the of the collider as it was initially designed.
%https://cerncourier.com/a/lhc-run-3-the-final-countdown/
CERN has embarked  on a very ambitious project, the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), that will dominate 
the accelerator-based particle physics scenario in the years to come. The HL-LHC consists on a luminosity-enhanced version of the LHC.

Adding more particles to the bunches and focusing more the beam, would result on a grater collision rate (of about a factor 10).
This provides the different analyses with better statistics, %more events or, as it frequently referred as, better statistics
which eventually results in more precise searches and measurements.
A peak instantaneous luminosity of \mbox{$\lumi = 7.5 \times 10^{34}\,$\lumiunits} is expected, this corresponds to between $140$ and $200$ inelastic $\Pproton \Pproton$ collisions
per bunch crossing, in contrast to the current $36.1$ recorded during last year of Run-2 (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:LHC:PileUp_15-18} shows the <$\mu$> for each year of Run-2).

In contrast to the timeline in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:HL-LHC}, the latest update of the schedule dates the Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) start in 2026 and the Run-4 start in 2029. 
All dates are subject to change as the unexpected events may occur or technical/scientific reasons may lead to re-schedules.

\begin{figure}
 	  \centering
 	  \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{Chapter2/HL-LHC-plan-2021-1}
	  \caption{Timeline for the LHC and LHC HL projects. The periods of data taking are named Runs 
	  and, between runs, there are the Long Shutdowns (LS) in which the different facilities are upgraded.}
	  \label{fig:Chap2:HL-LHC}
\end{figure} 


Some technologies developed to upgrade the LHC to HL-LHC are: % https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWz12_bwqEI
\begin{itemize}
	\item Shorter bending dipole magnets are going to be installed. The current ones have a length of $15\,$m while the new are only $5.5\,$m, 
	allowing the insertion of the colliamtors
	of Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:HL-Collimator}. The new niobium-tin dipole magnets will generate an $11\,$T magnetic field compared with the current $8.3\,$T.
	\begin{figure}
 	  \centering
 	  \includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Chapter2/HL-LHC-Collimator}
	  \caption{HL-LHC Collimator.}
	  \label{fig:Chap2:HL-Collimator}
	\end{figure} 

 	\item Brand new and more powerful superconducting quadrupole magnets 
	(up to $12\,$T) made of niobium and tin will substitute the current ones ($8\,$T). These magnets will be located
	at the sides of the ATLAS and CMS detectors
	\item New Beam optics. At present, as bunches cross, the protons collide and disappear and, hence, the luminosity decreases.
	For the Run-4, in order to keep the luminosity at the same level,
	the beam focusing is designed to keep the collision rate constant.
	\item Superconducting crab cavities for giving the bunches additional transverse momentum in order to increase the probability of collisions. 
	\item New collimator sand injection magnets will also improve the performance of the machine.
	\item Thanks to the new high-temperature superconductors, currents up to $10^5\,$Amperes will be carried over long distances.
	\item New collimators that produce less electromagnetic interference with the beam are being installed. Collimators (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:HL-Collimator})  are
	importante because the machine protection is based on them. This elements of the accelerator absorb particles that stray from the beam trajectory and can 
	harm the devices. 
	\item The accelerator chain is improved as well with the use of the linear accelerator LINAC4 and with upgrades in the PSB, PS and PSP.	
\end{itemize}



Although increasing the collision rate of the beams is a crucial goal for CERN, improving the accelerator is not enough.
The current detectors have not been designed for HL-LHC but for the LHC and, thus, cannot handle the increased luminosity.
By increasing the luminosity while keeping the same bunch spacing, a much higher rate of collisions per bunch crossing is
achieved and this implies and higher pile-up. For Run-2, the pile up peaked around $\mu_{max}\approx70$ and that was already
quite taxing for the system in terms of tracking and reconstruction, and for Run-4 it may start around 140 and increase to 200 
interactions per bunch crossing.

Next, the main upgrades of the ATLAS detector towards de HL-LHC project are presented. 

\paragraph{Inner Tracker}
The elements in the ID receive a lot of radiation damage due the huge rate of particles hitting the detector. This radiation environment will be
even more daunting in the HL project. Therefore, the design of ATLAS (as well as all other main detectors of LHC) has to be
reviewed, especially for the most central the parts of the detector.

To deal with this, ATLAS needs much more capable trackers, therefore, the entire ID is going to be replaced
with a new ``inner tracker'' (ITk). This new detector consist on cylinder and end-caps equipped with silicon
detectors covering  a geometrical acceptance of $|\eta| < 4$.  This
expanded pseudorapidity range introduces many advantages in terms of object reconstruction
and pile-up mitigation by linking objects to the primary vertex corresponding to the hard-scatter of interest.
The new pixels sensors will be placed very close to the interaction region, where the high 
fluencies ($2\times 10^{16}\,n_{eq}$cm$^{-2}$ in the HL vs the current $10^{15}\,n_{eq}$cm$^{-2}$)
have to be tolerated while maintaining a 96\% efficiency of particle detection \cite{CERN-LHCC-2017-021}. 

As well as the ID, the ITk is divided in two subsystems mounted in the pixel support tube: the Pixel Detectors and the strip detectors that surrounds the pixels.   
For the strips, there are four barrel layers and xix end-cap petals and for the pixels, five layers are used.


\paragraph{Calorimeters}
Due to radiation tolerance limits, the electronics for the ECAL and HCAL  have to be updated. The on-detector FE electronics 
cannot operate with the trigger rates and latencies required for the HL-LHC luminosities.
The FCAL will remain the same as in Run-2.

\paragraph{Muon Spectrometer}
The MS upgrades for the HL-LHC are focused on the muon trigger chambers. The Level-0 trigger electronics of the RPC and TCG 
will be upgraded and for the RPC the pseudorapidity coverage will be significantly increased. The front-end of the MDT is going to be 
replaced as well to address the trigger rate and latency requirements.

\paragraph{Trigger and Data Acquisition system}
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Chapter2/HL-Trigger}
\caption{	Design of the TDAQ Phase-II upgrade architecture, highlighting the organisation of the Upgrade 
		Project in three main systems \cite{CERN-LHCC-2017-020}. Direct connections 
	  	between each Level-0 trigger component and the Readout system are suppressed for simplicity.} 
		\label{fig:Chap2:HL-Trigger}
\end{wrapfigure} 

To reconstruct the events offline, they have to be recorded in the first place, otherwise, it makes no sense to have that huge $\Pproton \Pproton$ collision rate.
 This is why while the detector hardware is being heavily upgraded, a lot of effort is being put into the trigger systems. 
The new trigger system is a multistage system that progressively takes more and more detailed information and each 
step has more time to make this decision.
It starts with $40\,$MHz input rate ($40\time 10^{6}\,$input events per second). The triggering
process starts by the Level-0 (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:HL-Trigger} in purple) and makes very quick decisions ($10\,\mu$s latency), reducing the rate from 40 to $1\,$MHz.
Afterwards it passes to the event filter (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:HL-Trigger} in orange) which takes the $1\,$MHz down to $10\,$kHz that sends to permanent storage.
The key part is that these $10\,$kHz are really the most useful  $10\,$kHz \cite{CERN-LHCC-2017-020}. For doing so, the performance of the tracking is fundamental 
for things like particle flow identification, \MET measurements, jet tagging or tau identification.

%"Concerning the High Luminosity LHC, with the new schedule, LS3 will start in 2026 and the Run 4 would start in 2029. A new HL-LHC running parameters baseline is under discussion, which leads to new projections foreseeing 715/fb of pp data collected in Run 4. The beam energy for HL-LHC has also been discussed and several scenarios to reach 7 TeV per beam have been discussed. The high risk of warm-ups is a main concern and the decision will likely be postponed to the end of Run 3. Options to stay at 6.8 TeV or even backing off to 6.5 TeV to further avoid warm-ups are still on the table.

\section{Alignment of the inner detector}
\label{sec:Chap2:ID_alignement}
A fundamental part for the correct operation of the ATLAS detector is its alignment \cite{ATLAS:2020ixw}. The goal of
the detector alignment is to determine the detector geometry as accurately as possible in order to
correct the effects of any displacement. %In this section,
%the need of an adequate alignment is motivated, its principles discussed and my contributions presented. 
%\pablo{((los shifts no se mencionan como contribución, verdad?)}


As commented in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:ID}, the ID is used to reconstruct the 
trajectories of the charged particles by combining into tracks the energy deposits
(hits) of the particles as well as identifying  vertices. 
These functionalities are essential for some tasks such as the lepton reconstruction
or the \bjet tagging. To be able to have proper tracking, the full resolution of the ID has to be exploited and
to do so it is crucial to know the geometry of the detector, i.e. the location and
orientation of each of its elements. Due to several factors such as termal 
expansion/contraction or movings during the stops % because os the cooling system, the ramping of the magnetic field, 
the detector is constantly experiencing small movements that affect to its geometry. 
With the alignment it is possible to account online for this displacements, re-calibrate and correct its effects. %by online I mean "on real time"
The alignment algorithm's accuracy is such that the position of the various detector parts may be established with a few microns of accuracy \cite{ATLAS:1999vwa}.  
This accuracy is superior to that attained by directly measuring the module placements. 
Since any misalignment of the different elements of the ID will degrade the quality of the track reconstruction, 
which is vital to perform any physics analysis, a constant monitoring of the alignment is necessary.
During the development of this thesis, I have contributed to the alignment of the ID trough the refurbishment 
of the software package for monitoring the track-based ID alignment results obtained at the calibration 
loop and show them as a web-based service.

\subsubsection{Local coordinate frame and residuals}
%\subsubsection{Local coordinate frame}
\paragraph{Local coordinate frame}\mbox{}\\
In Section \ref{sec:Chap2:ATLAS:CoordinateSystem} the global (\textit{x, y, z}) Cartesian 
coordinate system of ATLAS was introduced. The local coordinate frame of an individual sensor
of the detector (\textit{x', y', z'}) is also a Cartesian system. The local system is a right-handed frame
with the origin placed at the geometrical centre of the module. According to the convention,
the \textit{x'}-axis and \textit{y'}-axis are within the plane of the component and the \textit{z'}-axis
points outside of this plane. The \textit{x'}-axis points to the most sensitive direction of the module. 
For the Pixel and IBL modules this is the shorter pitch side and, for the SCT, the perpendicular to the strip 
orientation. In the case of the TRT the \mbox{\textit{y'}-axis} points along the wire while the \textit{x'}-axis remains
perpendicular to both the wire and the radial direction. The local coordinates are represented schematically in 
Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:Alignment:LocalCoordinate}.

The hits are reconstructed in the local coordinate frame of the different
modules. %While for the Pixel modules the reconstruction it is straight forward,
%in the case of the SCT the information from the two local frames associated
%to the hit are used to reconstruct it.

\label{fig:Chap2:Alignment:LocalCoordinate}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Residuals}
\paragraph{Residulas}\mbox{}\\
In tracking, a residual is the distance between a hit and the intersection point of 
the extrapolated track in the sensor. The residual vector ($\bm{r}$) is define as:
\begin{equation*}
	\bm{r} = (\bm{m} - \bm{e}(\bm{\tau}, \bm{\alpha}) )
\end{equation*}
where $\bm{m}$ is the vector to center of the module and $\bm{e}(\bm{\tau}, \bm{\alpha})$
is the vector to the track intersection with the surface.  For every module crossed by the track there is a residual,
as it is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:Alignment:Residual}. The residuals are important since 
the alignment is based on their minimisation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Chapter2/Alignment_residual}
\caption{Schematic representation of a charged particle crossing detector planes \cite{ATLAS:2020ixw}.  
The red star measures represents the measurement in each layer ($m_i$). The black line is the 
fitted trajectory for a given set of track parameters. The position of the intersection of the fitted 
track with the surface ($\bm{e_{i}}$) on which the $i^{th}$ measurement is made is indicated with a
green elipse. The residuals ($\bm{r_{i}}$) are shown in blue.}
\label{fig:Chap2:Alignment:Residual}
\end{figure}


%\subsubsection{Track parameters}
\subsubsection{Track parameters and degrees of freedom}
The trajectory followed by a charged particle within a magnetic field $B$ is an helix that 
can be fully parametrised by the five track parameters: 
$\bm{\tau} = (d_{0},\, z_{0},\, \phi_{0},\, \theta_{0},\, q/p)$, where $d_{0}$ and $z_{0}$  
are the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters; $\phi_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ the 
azimuthal and polar angles of the track.  Lastly, the $q/p$ is ratio between the particles
charge and momentum and it measures the curvature of the tracks. 

%\subsubsection{Alignment levels and degrees of freedom}
The orientation of a rigid body can be described by a total of six degrees of freedom. 
This is translated into what are known as alignment parameters 
$\bm{\alpha} = (T_{x},\, T_{y},\, T_{z},\, R_{x},\, R_{y},\,R_{z})$. These correspond to the
three translations with respect to the origin of the local reference frame ($T_{x,y,z}$) 
and three rotations ($R_{x,y,z}$) around the local Cartesian axes. 




\subsection{Track based alignment}
%The distance between the hits and the fitted track should be null if the detector was perfectly aligned, 
%and the residual distribution would be centred at zero and have a width that corresponded to the 
In the case of a perfectly aligned detector, the residual distribution would be centred at 
zero and have a width that corresponds to the
module resolution. Therefore, any deviation from the residual distribution indicates a 
misalignment of the detector. 


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{Chapter2/AlignmentChain_ToBeVectorised}
\caption{Alignment procedure scheme where each rectangle is a detector module. 
	The left panel represents the real position of the detector modules and the charged particle track.
	The middle panel shows the initially-expected position of the modules and the reconstructed track.
	The right panel exemplifies how the position of the detectors has been updated to resemble the real one.
	This update is done by the track-based alignment procedure.   \pablo{ I need to vectorise this image} 
	}
	
\label{fig:Chap2:Alignment:Chain}
\end{figure}

A schematic description of the alignment chain is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:Alignment:Chain}.
The blue rectangles on the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:Alignment:Chain} represent the true position of 
the detector modules. A charged particle deposits part of its energy in each module producing hits, 
which are marked with red dots. The track of the particle is marked with a red line. The $x$ distance
is the deviation of the module from its apparent position. In the middle panel, the white rectangles
represent the apparent position of each module. Here can be seen how the real position and the 
apparent one is not the same by an unknown distance $x$. This deviation leads to a discrepancy between 
the reconstructed tracks and the true ones. The residuals in the middle panel are represented by a green
line, which corresponds to the difference between the recorded track (red dots) and the reconstructed
one (blue dots). The residual distributions in this panel are displaced from zero, indicating a misalignment.
The purpose of the alignment algorithm is to center this distributions in zero by minimising these residuals.
As a result of the alignment procedure, the position of the detectors has been updated a distance $x'$ 
for each module. After this, the new expected position of the modules (green rectangles) is much closer to 
the real one and, hence, the residuals are more centred at zero. Anyhow, this is not perfect and the different
$x'$  are not all equal to $x$. To improve the precision, the alignment procedure is repeated iteratively until
convergence of the corrections.

\subsubsection{Global $\chi^2$ algorithm} %1 or 2 pages explaining the algorithm
To correct the position of the ID, the alignment constants ($\bm{\alpha}$) are obtained as result 
of the minimisation of the $\chi^2$ function. This function is built from the track-hit residuals:
\begin{equation*}
	\chi^{2} =  \sum_{t} \sum_{h} \left( \frac{r_{t,h}(\bm{\tau}, \bm{\alpha})}{\sigma_{h}} \right)^{2},
\end{equation*}
where the index $t$ runs over the reconstructed tracks and the $h$ is the set of hits associated to each 
track $t$. The residual of each hit associated to track $t$ is $r_{t,h}$ and $\sigma_{h}$ is the hit's uncertainty.
In vector notation, the $\chi^2$ function can be expressed as:
\begin{equation*}
	\chi^{2} =  \sum_{t} \bm{r}^{T}\Omega^{-1} \bm{r},
\end{equation*}
where $\Omega$ is the covariance matrix of the corresponding measurements. 
The track parameters $\bm{\tau}$ are those that minimise the $\chi^2$ and, therefore,
first and second derivatives of $\chi^2$ with respect $\bm{\tau}$  are used. %The summatory
%on $t$ runs over all traces. 
%Defining the derivative $G = d \bm{\tau}/\bm{r}%
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d \chi^{2}}{d \bm{\tau}} =
	 \sum_{t} \left[  \left(\frac{d  \bm{r} }{d \bm{\alpha}} \right)^{T} \Omega^{-1} \bm{r} \right]^{T} +
	 \sum_{t} \left[  (\bm{r}^{T} \Omega^{-1} \left( \frac{d \bm{r}}{d \bm{\alpha}} \right) \right]
	= 0
\end{equation*}
It is worth to remind that $\bm{r}$ and $\Omega$ are defined for a single track, so the summatory will 
accumulate the residuals from all considered tracks from all the events in the data sample. The last 
expresión can be simplified taking into account that $\Omega^{-1}$ is symmetric and it takes the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Chap2:Chi2_A}
	2 \sum_{t} \left(\frac{d  \bm{r} }{d \bm{\alpha}} \right)^{T} \Omega^{-1} \bm{r} = 0
\end{equation}
Since $\bm{r} = \bm{r}(\bm{\tau}, \bm{\alpha})$, the partial derivatives have to be taken into account:
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d  \bm{r} }{d \bm{\alpha}} =
	 \frac{\partial  \bm{r} }{\partial \bm{\tau}} \frac{d  \bm{\tau} }{d \bm{\alpha}} + 
	  \frac{\partial  \bm{r} }{\partial \bm{\alpha}} 
\end{equation*}
Inserting this into Eq. \ref{eq:Chap2:Chi2_A}, the condition for minimising the $\chi^{2}$ turns 
to be:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Chap2:Chi2_B}
	\sum_{t} \left(\frac{\partial  \bm{r} }{\partial \bm{\tau}} \frac{d  \bm{\tau} }{d \bm{\alpha}} + 
	  \frac{\partial  \bm{r} }{\partial \bm{\alpha}} \right)^{T} \Omega^{-1} \bm{r} = 0 \; .
\end{equation}
\begin{comment}
Here, the term $d\bm{\tau} / d\bm{\alpha}$ is of particular importance since its contains
the relationship between the track and alignment parameters, and it will determine 
the difference between the \textit{Local}  and \textit{Global} $\chi^{2}$ algorithms.

If the algorithm assumes that track parameters do not depend on the alignment, i.e.
$d\bm{\tau} / d\bm{\alpha} = 0$, it is the so-called \textit{Local} $\chi^{2}$ algorithm.
%In this case, the total derivative in Equation \ref{eq:Chap2:Chi2_A} is reduced to 
%the partial derivative of  \with respect to the 
On the other hand, the \textit{Global} $\chi^{2}$ is based on the assumption that 
the track and alignment parameters are dependent. 
\end{comment}


The tack parameters that satisfy the relation in Eq. \ref{eq:Chap2:Chi2_B} are found 
by an iterative process consisting on evaluating the first and second derivatives
of the $\chi^{2}$ with respect to the current iteration track parameters, $\bm{\tau}_{0}$.
Since the derivative terms of Eq. \ref{eq:Chap2:Chi2_B} depend on $\bm{\tau}$ itself, 
 the procedure is repeated until a convergence criteria is met.
 
 Additionally, the track fit can be further improved by adding supplementary constraining terms that account 
 for the effects of multiple Coulomb scatterings of the particle with the detector.

% Twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/AlignmentWebDisplayHowTo
% Git repository: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-idalignment/InDetAlignmentWebMonitor
The ID Alignment Monitoring Web Display (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:Alignment:WebDisplay}) is an application intended for monitoring the track-based
alignment results obtained at the calibration loop for the ID. It helps to evaluate the computed 
alignment corrections as well as many graphical distributions related with the performance 
(for example, the detector residuals). \pablo{I have not explained what the calibration loop is :(}

The web application consists in a server, managed by ATLAS Distributed Computing, and a
collection of scripts to produce distributions, update the information and handle the http requests.
It is available at Athena\footnote{Athena is a
concrete realisation of a component-based architecture (ased on LHCb's Gaudi \cite{Mato:1998gfa}) 
which was designed for a wide range of physics data-processing applications.}, 
the software framework for ATLAS \cite{Duckeck:2005rb}. 

Part of my personal work has consisted in writing the code for both
the frontend and backend of the ID Alignment Monitoring Web Display. 
From an outdated set of scripts, the backend of the application has been remodelled. In the new version
all the code duplicities have been suppressed by defining classes, methods and functions. 
%The same lines where written over and over again.
Several new functionalities have been added, to name some:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The web uses the standard Athena setup instead of loading a 
	bash script in which the Athena version had to be hardcoded.
	\item Debug levels using ATLAS printing style methods have been implemented.
	\item Now it is possible to update a single run or list of runs while in the 
	previous version it was necessary to execute the program over all runs again.
	\item It is not necessary to hardcode the year anymore, it is automatically now.
	\item Depending on which run was decided to plot, it was necessary to hardcode
	the year in he scripts. Now the web tool allows to do this from its interface.
	\item In the new version it is possible to access the ATLAS Metadata Interface\footnote{
	Known as AMI, it is a generic software ecosystem for retrieving scientific data by metadata 
	criteria. It allows to search for real and simulated data by metadata criteria as well as browse, view, 
	compare and create ATLAS AMI-Tags} information.
	\item The runtime of the code has been speed up by performing the execution in a single loop in contrast
	to the two-loops structure of the previous version. 
	% Before we used to make a loop over all runs (\texttt{runListInTestingFolder}) 
	% and if for a certain run the info had to be updated or it was new, we added this 
	% run to a list (\texttt{RunsWithNewData}) over which we made a second loop fill 
	% the information. Now we do everything in a single loop over all runs filling the 
	% info on the fly if necessary. This makes the code more clean, clear and 
	% understandable.

Regarding the frontend, it has been developed from the scratch. 
The aesthetics of the web page is the most visible change in the monitor display.
The frontend code is based on CherryPy \cite{CherryPyDoc}, an object-oriented web application framework using 
the Python programming language, and also includes CSS, HTML and Java.
The enhanced web display allows to easily choose which information is shown.  
The web has been designed to adapt to mobile devices, 
as Figure \ref{fig:Chap2:Alignment:WebDisplay_mobile} shows. To do so, it uses Bootstrap,
a CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first frontend web development .


The navigation bar of the web has also being improved, having a better organisation, more 
option and, if the browser screen is narrowed, it collapses into a desplegable sidebar.
A filter has been added that allows to show only the runs that follow the desired specific criteria.
A desplegable to select the years has been included, the script reads from the available 
years in the database. A year selector presentes the possible years via a script that
reads the available data. The hoover function highlights the text as the pointer goes
over it. The plots are presented in a cleaner way using grid view to select the plot of interest
and light boxes to highlight them. The legends of the plots have also been modified
to remove duplicated items.

\section{Basic concepts for accelerator physics}
\label{sec:Chap2:LHC:lumi}
\pablo{Aún hay que ver por dónde pongo esta sección,}

In this section are covered some fundamental concepts in accelerator physics. 
These concepts include energy, luminosity, and cross section. Understanding 
these elements is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of particle accelerators 
and the results obtained from particle-physics experiments.

\subsection{Energy}
\label{sec:Chap1:LHC:Energy}
%\paragraph{Energy}\mbox{}\\
Another name to refer to the field of Particle Physics is ``high energy physics''. Particles such as the Higgs boson or the top quark are 
more than 100 times heavier than the proton so, in order to produce them, huge energies are required.
The centre-of-mass energy, \CM, allows the production of physical effects. The greater the energy is, 
the larger is the range of the different processes that can be produced by the accelerator. 

The four-vector, $\pfour  =  (E, \momentum)$, of a particle of mass $m$ describes its kinematics with its energy $E$ and \momentum.
The square of the four-vector, $\pfour^2$, corresponds to the particle mass:
\begin{equation}
	\pfour^2 = E^2 - \momentum^2 = m^2
\end{equation}
When two particles of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$  and momenta $\momentum_1$ and $\momentum_2$ respectively collide, the centre-of-mass energy,
\CM, can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Chap2:EnergyGeneral}
	s = E^{2}_{CM} = (\pfour_1 + \pfour_2)^2 = (E_1 +E_2)^2 - (\momentum_1 +  \momentum_2)^2
\end{equation}

For symmetric colliding beams, such those of LHC, the collision point is at rest in the laboratory frame ($\momentum_1 = -\momentum_2$) and, hence, 
the energy is 
\begin{equation}
	s = E^{2}_{CM} = (E_1 +E_2)^2 
\end{equation}
Since the  energy of each beam is $6.5\,$TeV during Run-2, the centre-of-mass energy of LHC collisions is % as explained in Section \ref{sec:Chap2:LHC:AcceleratorComplex}

\begin{equation}
	\CM = E_{CM} = (E_{beam1} + E_{beam2}) = 6.5\,\textrm{TeV} + 6.5\,\textrm{TeV} = 13\,\textrm{TeV}
\end{equation}

\begin{comment}
When LHC is used for fix target experiments, one of the particles in the collision is at rest ($\momentum_2 = 0$) and the Eq. \ref{eq:Chap2:EnergyGeneral}
writes as:
\begin{equation}
	E^{2}_{CM} = (m_{1}^2 +m_{2^2 } + 2m_{2}E_{1,lab})
\end{equation}
Then, the energy for a $\Pproton \Pproton$ fix target collision with one beam at $650\,$GeV is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	E^{2}_{CM} 	&= (m_{p}^2  +m_{p}^2  + 2m_{p}E_{beam}) \\
				&= 2(0.938\,\textrm{GeV})^2 + 2\cdot0.938\,\textrm{GeV} \cdot 650\,\textrm{GeV} = 1221.2\,\textrm{GeV}^2\\
	E_{CM}		&= 34.9\,\textrm{GeV}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This shows why colliding beams are essential to achieve high center of mass energies.

%        Luminosity     %

\subsection{Luminosity}
\label{sec:Chap1:LHC:Cross-Luminosity}
%\paragraph{Luminosity}\mbox{}\\
Luminosity plays a pivotal role in determining the rate at which particle interactions occur, 
thus influencing the experimental data obtained.
Besides \CM, the luminosity is the most relevant parameter in an experiment,  and it is especially 
important in searches for events with small cross-section.
It measures the ability of the particle accelerator to produce enough events of the desired type.

The luminosity, $\lumi(t)$, is the ratio of events detected in a certain period of time for a given cross-section ($\sigma$):
\begin{equation}
\lumi = \frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{1}{\sigma} R
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of the events and $t$ the time. $R=\frac{dN}{dt}$ is known as event rate. It can be understood as number of 
particle collision per unit area (typically expressed in cm$^2$) and per second, therefore it is measured in \lumiunits \cite{Herr:941318}.  
For instance, for LEP was $\lumi_{LEP}=1.0\times10^{32}\,$\lumiunits and the LHC is designed to achieve $\lumi_{LHC_{pp}}=2.1\times10^{34}\,$\lumiunits 
in $\Pproton\Pproton$ collisions and $\lumi_{LHC_{PbPb}}=6.1\times10^{27}\,$\lumiunits for heavy ion collisions.

% The luminosity is proportional to the number of bunches per beam ($n$), the revolution frequency ($f$) and the number 
%of particles in each bunch ($N_1$ and $N_2$), and inversely proportional to the beam cross-section ($A$)
%\begin{equation}
%\lumi = \frac{nfN_{1}N_{2}}{A}
%\end{equation}

For a circular collider, the instantaneous luminosity is proportional  to the number of bunches per beam ($n_1$ and $n_2$), the revolution frequency ($f$) with 
which the bunches are crossing and the number of proton bunches in the machine ($n_b$), and it is and inversely proportional to the beams effective transverse area in which the collision takes places (Area = $4 \pi\sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}$) 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Chap2:LumiInst}
\lumi = f \cdot \frac{n_{1} n_{2} n_{b}}{4 \pi\sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}\cdot F(\theta_{c},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{z})
\end{equation}
where $F(\theta_{c},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{z})$ is a factor accounting for the luminosity reduction due to the beam crossing angle ($\theta_c$).
At  the LHC, assuming that the particles travel at the speed of light, for its $27\,$km, the bunch crossing frequency is $f = 11245.5\,$Hz. 
The maximum number of proton bunches in the machine is\footnote{The theoretical maximum of 3564 bunches cannot 
be reached due to space needed between bunch trains and for the beam dump kicker magnets.} $n_b$ = 2808. 
 In each bunch there are $n_1 \approx n_2 \approx 1.15 \times 10^{11}$ particles. Finally, characterising the optics of the collision at the interaction point (IP), the RMS transverse beam width in the horizontal and vertical directions are $\sigma_{x} \approx \sigma_{y} \approx 12, ... , 50\,\mu m$. The expression \ref{eq:Chap2:LumiInst} assumes that the particles in the beam are Gaussian distributed.
According to equation \ref{eq:Chap2:LumiInst} the instantaneous luminosity only depends on the machine and its beam parameters \cite{Hoecker:2016vvy}\cite{ATLAS:2016fhk}. 
     

The integrated luminosity over time is given by 
\begin{equation}
	 L = \int \lumi dt
 \end{equation}
 and it is used to determine the number of events, $N$, that have taken place during that time: $N = \sigma \times L$. 
 The number of observed events in then:
 \begin{equation}
	N^{obs}_{events} = \sigma_{process} \times \textrm{efficiency} \times L \, ,
 \end{equation}
where the efficiency of the detection is to be optimised by the experimental physicist, the integrated luminosity ($L$) is delivered by LHC and the cross-section of the 
process ($\sigma_{process}$) is given by nature.

\pablo{I could remove everything about factors that minimise the luminosity and strategies to fix it.}
Several factors can limit the maximum luminosity that can be achieved at LHC \cite{Herr:941318}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Beam-beam effect}: The bunches of two beams or the particles in the same bunch can interact electromagnetically, this leads to distortions from the orbit and results in an increase of the emittance, $\epsilon$.
	\item \textbf{Crossing angle}: Often used to avoid unwanted collisions in machines with many bunches, due to the crossing angle $\theta_c$, 
				the luminosity is reduced by a factor $F(\theta_{c},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{z}) = \sqrt{1+(\theta_{c}\sigma_{z}/2\sigma{x})^2}$.
	\item \textbf{Beam offset}: Originated from the beam-beam effects or misalignments in the quadrupole magnets, the beams can collide with 
				small transverse offset. Such beams' offsets induce a loss of $\lumi$ at the interaction point.
	\item \textbf{Hourglass effect}: Appears when beams collide in a point away from the IP. 
\end{itemize}

On the other hand, there are diverse strategies to maximise the luminosity delivered by a machine \cite{Hoecker:2016vvy}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Maximise the total beam current}: Improvements in beam collimation, cryogenics vacuum and background protection could extend the limit on the maximum beam current. 
	\item \textbf{Compensate reduction factor}: The hourglass effect may be reduced by shorter bunches at the expense of a higher longitudinal pileup density (see Section \ref{sec:Chap2:LHC:pileup}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cross section}
\label{sec:Chap1:LHC:Cross-Section}
%\paragraph{Cross-section}\mbox{}\\
The cross section ($\sigma$) is a metric of how likely is a particular reaction to occur. 
It is formally defined as the effective area that characterises the interaction probability between two particles. 
Mathematically, it is expressed as:
\begin{equation*}
\sigma = \frac{\text{number of interactions}}{\text{number of incident particles}  \times \text{solid angle}}
\end{equation*}

The higher the cross section is for a process, the more probable is for it to take place. %how often a process occurs
Denoted by $\sigma$, it is measured in units of area named barns: 1 barn = b = $10^{-24}\,$$\textrm{ cm}^2$. For instance, for the LHC energy:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sigma(\Pproton\Pproton \rightarrow X) \approx 0.1\,$b
	\item $\sigma(\Pproton\Pproton \rightarrow X + \PH) \approx 1 \times 10^{-11}\,$b
	\item $\sigma(\Pproton\Pproton \rightarrow X + \PH$; $\PH \rightarrow \Pgamma \Pgamma) \approx 50 \times 10^{-15}\,$b
\end{itemize}

%In experiments with a rotational symmetry, such is the case for ATLAS, it is usual to define the differential cross section ($\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$) as the cross section per solid angle. 
%If the differential cross section is integrated over corresponding the angular range, the cross-section for a specific region ($\sigma_{\varphi}$) is obtained:
%\begin{equation}
%	\sigma_{\vartheta} = \int_{0}^{\vartheta} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \textrm{sin}(\vartheta)\, d\phi d\vartheta
%\end{equation}
%with $\vartheta \in [0, \pi]$ is the coverage of the scattering angle.

It is usual to define the differential cross-section ($\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$) as the cross-section per solid angle. 
If the differential cross-section is integrated over corresponding the angular range, the cross section 
for a specific region ($\sigma_{\varphi}$) is obtained:

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{equation*}
	\sigma_{\vartheta} = \int_{0}^{\vartheta} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \textrm{sin}(\vartheta)\, d\phi d\vartheta
\end{equation*}
where $\vartheta \in [0, \pi]$ is the coverage of the scattering angle.

%\begin{comment}
%\pablo{this paragraph may be removed}
The total cross-section is determined by the amplitude of the scattering matrix $\mathcal{M}$, 
which is independent of the experimental setup. The $\mathcal{M}$, also known as scattering amplitude, 
relates the initial state and the final state of a physical system undergoing a scattering process.
The $\mathcal{M}$ is calculated by summing all possible Feynman diagrams contributing to the hard-scatter
process at the desired order.
Using $\mathcal{M}$, the total cross-section for a process is determined by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chap1:Pheno:XS}
	\sigma_{tot} = \int \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \, d\Omega = \int \frac{1}{\Phi} |\mathcal{M}|^{2}\, dQ
\end{equation}
being $\Phi$ the incident particle flux in the process and the parameter $dQ$ describes the kinematic phase space.
%The $\mathcal{M}$ is often referred as Matrix Element (ME).
