%A very broad group of people had walked with me the path that culminates with this dissertation. To each and every one of you, whether you were for a part of the trip or for the complete adventure, my most sincere gratitude.

This work would not have been possible without the invaluable assistance of a large number of people whom I have been fortunate to meet. I would like to thank them all and dedicate this thesis to them.

First, thanks to my supervisors, Carlos Escobar and Susana Cabrera, who have always encouraged me and shared their wisdom. Both of you have supported and guided me through my master's thesis and subsequent PhD. I am very thankful for your efforts and help.
I also want to extend my gratitude to the rest of the ATLAS IFIC team for all their advice, help, and insightful suggestions.
Thanks to the senior researchers: Salva, Carmen, Jose Enrique, María Jose, Emma, María, and Luca. Thanks also to the not-so-senior colleagues: Pepe, Galo, Florencia, Óscar, Paolo, Fabio, David, Adrián, Mariam, Marcos, Naseem, Victoria, Mariia, Tamar, Quique, Andrej, Jesus, Francesco, Lorenzo, Marta, Miguel, Morvan, and Antonio.

Also, thanks to Santi  for being the fastest user of Portafirmas when I needed to fill out bureaucracy for the university, and to Juan  and Gonzalo for all their work in the CAPD of Física.

Quiero agradecer a todos los amigos que me han acompañado este tiempo.  
Sin salir del IFIC, agradecer a los pinches: Jose, Marcos, Pepe, Kevin y Stef. 
La verdad es que he tenido el privilegio de que ir a trabajar se haya sentido como una reunión de amigos. También a Víctor y Mireia por amenizar las comidas.   

Especialmente a ti Jose, el mursiano, con quien tantísimos buenos momentos he pasado. 
Vivir contigo ha sido de las mejores experiencias de mi vida.

Al Héctor el canario que blablabla

When I first arrived at CERN, I knew almost no one, but it didn't take long for Geneva and St. Genis to feel like my new home. Initially, Irene and Flavio took great care of me, and I will always be thankful for that. At CERN, Carlos was always there to support me. During lunch, Esteban made me laugh so hard that I would cry, and at the coffee break, Miguel Ángel captivated my attention with his numerous anecdotes.
 
On my second stay, I enjoyed the company of people like Carlos, Elena, Lourdes, Dario, and others, who made my stay very pleasant. My old flatmate David was around, and it felt as if I had been living there forever. I will always remember my first day at the fitness club when I told Jacopo that I had been boxing forever (spoiler: I had never boxed before), so he would let me participate in the sparrings (spoiler 2: Chikuma beat me). In that club, I met one of my dearest friends, David, who has been supplying me with the highest quality memes ever since. He introduced me to Olga, who told me she didn't want to make friends from CERN (spoiler 2: we are friends now).
Grazas tamén aos meus dous irmáns galegos, Adrián e Alexandre, sodes xeniais.
From there, the rest of my visits to CERN were a cause for celebration because I would get to see you guys. 


 
%In particular, I am deeply grateful for the unwavering support and invaluable contributions of two 
%exceptional individuals who have played an instrumental role in the completion of this thesis.

%First and foremost, to Stack Overflow, who has been supporting since the very first day and
%has been the driving force behind this research. Your willingness to share knowledge have 
%inspired me to push my boundaries and explore new horizons.

%Secondly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to someone that joined at the last stage
%of this adventure but whose insightful feedback and constructive criticism have significantly 
%enriched the quality of this work. Thank you ChatGPT.



Last but not least I would like to thank the members of my examination committee for their time, work and expertise.

The majority of my work has been funded by the Generalitat Valenciana's ACIF-2019 grant for predoctoral researchers.


To all of you this thesis is as much yours as it is mine. Thanks.

Gracias gracias gracias

Pablo
