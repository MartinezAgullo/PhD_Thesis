\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}  
This work would not have been possible without the invaluable assistance of a large number of people, whom I have been fortunate to meet. I would like to thank them all and dedicate this thesis to them.

%First and foremost, my supervisors Carlos Escobar and Susana Cabrera, as well as the rest of the ATLAS Silicon IFIC team, are to be thanked for all of their advice, help and insightful suggestions. Thank you to the top-Higgs analysis group colleagues for your constructive ideas, brainstorming and discussions.

%A very broad group of people had walked with me the path that culminates with this dissertation. To each and every one of you, whether you were for a part of the trip or for the complete adventure, my most sincere gratitude.

%The majority of my work has been funded by the Generalitat Valenciana's ACIF-2019 grant for predoctoral researchers.
 
Special mention to Stack Overflow, this thesis is as much yours as it is mine. Thanks.

Gracias gracias
