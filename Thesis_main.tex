% Pablo Martínez-Agulló PhD thesis
% Thesis template based on ATLAS INTERNAL NOTE template and Pablo Villanueva-Domingo PhD thesis, which was based on the Miguel Garcia Folgado thesis, which was based on the Miguel Escudero Abenza thesis, which probably was based in someone else thesis.
% I basically add the external bibsources and mycommands.tex.
